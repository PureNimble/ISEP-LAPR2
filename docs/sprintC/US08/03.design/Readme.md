### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * PublishAnnouncement

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * PublishAnnouncementRequestUI
 * PublishAnnouncementRequestController
 * AnnouncementRequestMapper

### Alternative 2 - Split Diagram

This diagram shows the same sequence of interactions between the classes involved in the realization of this user story, but it is split in partial diagrams to better illustrate the interactions between the classes.

It uses interaction ocurrence.
