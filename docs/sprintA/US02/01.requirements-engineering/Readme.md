### 1.1. User Story Description

>   In case the property is a house, the existence of a basement, an inhabitable loft, and sun exposure will be registered as well.



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** We are having a little issue defining what the sun exposure might be. We are not sure what it will be as a value. If it's a number that defines how much exposure the house has or if it is just a text saying if it has or hasn't sun exposure.
>
> **Answer:** Sun exposure will take the following values: North, South, Eat or West.


> **Question:** Is the phone call the only way the agent can receive the sale announcement? Or he can receive them via e-mail/letter/etc.
>
> **Answer:**  For now this is the only way.


> **Question:**  The act of publishing a sale announcement means that the agent is publishing a new property for sale in the system (receiving the information of the seller and publishing the new property for sale) or is it the buyer giving positive feedback to the agent with intent to buy the property(actually closing a sale, buying a property and de-listing said property)?
>
> **Answer:**  In US2 we get "As an agent, I can publish any sale announcement on the system, for example received through a phone call". Additional information related with this question is also avaliable in the project description.
>

> **Question:** What would be the attributes of the Owner and Agent?
>
> **Answer:** The Owner attributes are: the name, the citizen's card number, the tax number, the address, the email address and the contact
telephone number. The Agent is an employee of the company.


> **Question:** When a sale order arrives at the agent, what are the acceptance criteria that he (the agent) uses to accept or reject the order? Is there a possibility for an agent to refuse due to a lack of data on the property's characteristics of a property given by the owner? Or when the request arrives at the agent, are all the essential characteristics of the property in question already present?
>
> **Answer:** Yes.


> **Question:**  Is it necessary to publish the owner atributes on the sale announcement?
>
>  **Answer:** No.

> **Question:** If the comission is percentage[/value] what is the value? Is it the same for all agents?
> 
> **Answer:** There is no maximum and the minimum is 0. The commission is for the agency and for that given property.

> **Question:** If it's a property for lease is the comission value adjusted for the monthly value and contract duration? What is the value or method for calculating the comission?
>
> **Answer:** The commission is one value/percentage paid when the transaction is made.

> **Question:** Is it mandatory for the agent to input the commission value before publishing an announcement?
>
> **Answer:** Yes.

> **Question:** Are there only 2 types of commission or can the Administrator define more types of commission?
> 
>  **Answer:** For now we only have two types of commissions.

> **Question:** Another doubt that has emmerged is related to the identification of the owner of the property, isn't it required that the owner identifies themselves in the announcement ?
>
>  **Answer:** Info about the owner is not published.

> **Question:** In USS02 are all the criteria for publishing the sale of a property in the system mandatory, or is there any data that the owner can choose not to give? such as not saying the direction of sun exposure in the case of a house.
>
>  **Answer:** The number of bathrooms, the available equipment and the sun exposure are not mandatory. At least one photograph is required.
