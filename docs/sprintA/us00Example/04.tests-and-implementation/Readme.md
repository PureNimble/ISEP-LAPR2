# US 006 - To create a Task 

# 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Task instance = new Task(null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
	}
	

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with a reference containing less than five chars - AC2. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureReferenceMeetsAC2() {
		Category cat = new Category(10, "Category 10");
		
		Task instance = new Task("Ab1", "Task Description", "Informal Data", "Technical Data", 3, 3780, cat);
	}

# 5. Construction (Implementation)


## Class CreateTaskController 

```java
public Task createTask(String reference, String description, String informalDescription,
								 String technicalDescription, Integer duration, Double cost,
								 String taskCategoryDescription) {

	TaskCategory taskCategory = getTaskCategoryByDescription(taskCategoryDescription);

	Employee employee = getEmployeeFromSession();
	Organization organization = getOrganizationRepository().getOrganizationByEmployee(employee);

	newTask = organization.createTask(reference, description, informalDescription, technicalDescription, 
			duration, cost,taskCategory, employee);
    
	return newTask;
}
```


## Class Organization

```java
public Optional<Task> createTask(String reference, String description, String informalDescription,
                                     String technicalDescription, Integer duration, Double cost,
                                     TaskCategory taskCategory, Employee employee) {
    
        Task task = new Task(reference, description, informalDescription, technicalDescription, duration, cost,
                taskCategory, employee);

        addTask(task);
        
        return task;
    }
```

# 6. Integration and Demo 

* A new option on the Employee menu options was added.

* Some demo purposes some tasks are bootstrapped while system starts.


# 7. Observations

Platform and Organization classes are getting too many responsibilities due to IE pattern and, therefore, they are becoming huge and harder to maintain. 

Is there any way to avoid this to happen?
