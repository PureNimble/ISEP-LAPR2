# US 015 - As an agent, I intend to list all booking requests for properties managed by me.

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As an agent, I intend to list all booking requests for properties managed by me.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	After consulting a list of properties, the client can request to schedule a visit to the real estate agent for a specific property to verify its conditions. The agent receives the request, checks the availability and sends the response. If the customer accepts the order, it is automatically scheduled in the system.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **29 de May de 2023**
> 
>> **Question:** Booking is a slightly vague word. Our team wants clarifications on what type of requests the word encompasses (visit requests being our strongest guess, but we are not sure).
>>
>> **Answer:**  It is a visit request.


>  **30 de May de 2023**

>> **Question:** US015's AC1 states that "The list of requests must be shown for a specific period (begin date, end date)". As such, our team would like to know if you want this time period to be selected or typed, and in which format it should be in.
>>
>> **Answer:** The dates should be selected. The format should be DD-MM-YYYY.
>
>> **Question:** US015's AC2 states that "The list of requests must be sorted by date in ascending order. The sorting algorithm to be used by the application must be defined through a configuration file. At least two sorting algorithms should be available." As such, the team would like to know if this requirement will be part of the user's interaction with this US, or if it's just there for flexibility purposes. By that we mean to ask if the client will be able to chose which sorting method they want to apply, even if the end result will always be the same, or if we will provide those methods but chose which one is actually going to sort the list, without the client's awareness, as all they did was ask to see the list and the program showed them the end result. If we are to chose which one of the methods will be used, should we chose the most efficient one? It seems like a no brainer question, but we would still like to make sure we are following your vision for the program.
>>
>> **Answer:** The sorting algorithm to use should be defined in a configuration file. Please study ESOFT and discuss your question with ESOFT teatchers. In AC2 of US15 we get "The list of requests must be sorted by date in ascending order. The sorting algorithm to be used by the application must be defined through a configuration file. At least two sorting algorithms should be available."
>
>> **Question:** In US015's AC1, it is stated that "The list of requests must be shown for a specific period (begin date, end date)." This time period caused confusion, as the team is unsure whether the "date" is referring to the date chosen by the client in the message (See US009's requirements) or the date of creation of the visit request.
>>
>>  **Answer:** The goal is to use the date chosen by the client (the preferred date that you can see in US9) to list booking requests.
>
>> **Question:** When the agent requests the booking requests list to contact the client, that list should ONLY contain the requests related to that agent?
>>
>>  **Answer:** Yes. Listing is a feature described in US15.Important: In US15 the Agent gets a list of booking requests (made to him). Then, the agent, may want to respond to the user (as defined in US16). US15 and US16 are executed sequentially. Even so, the agent should be able to see a list of all booking requests made to him (US15) without answer any booking request.

>> **Question:** One of our questions' answers made us believe there might have been some miscommunication, as it had some significant mistakes in phrasing and your answer wasn't clear enough. As such, here is that same question, in a simpler and clearer way: US017's AC2 states that "Two sorting algorithms should be implemented (to be chosen manually by the network manager)." US015's AC2 states that "The list of requests must be sorted by date in ascending order. The sorting algorithm to be used by the application must be defined through a configuration file. At least two sorting algorithms should be available." As such, the team would like to know if, just like in US017, the sorting methods would be chosen manually in US015.
>>
>> **Answer:**  In US 15 the sorting algorithm to be used by the application must be defined through a configuration file. This is a diferent strategy from what I want in US17. Please study ESOFT.

> **Question:** The US15 does the listing and in US16 we are already responsing to one booking request. That said, were is the selection part being done?

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The list of requests must be shown for a specific period (begin date, end date).
* **AC2:** The list of requests must be sorted by date in ascending order. The sorting algorithm to be used by the application must be defined through a configuration file. At least two sorting algorithms should be available.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US009 As a client, I want to leave a message to the agent to schedule a visit to a property of my interest." since at least a message must exist to list the booking requests.
* There is a dependency to "US002 As an agent, I can publish any sale annoucement on the system, for example received through a phone call." and in "US008 As an agent, I intend to see the list of property announcement requests made to myself, so that I can post the announcement" because in these US an agent is associated with each property / announcement.
* There is a dependency to "US003 As a system administrator, I want to register a new employee." because the agent, in order to see the booking requests made, should be registered in the application.


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* N/a
	
* Selected data:
	* Begin Date
    * End Date


**Output Data:**

* List of begin dates
* List of end dates
* List of booking requestes to select
* (In)Success of the operation
