### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Offer

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

* ListDealsUI
* ListDealsController
* OfferMapper
* OfferRepository


## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

### Alternative 1 - Full Diagram

This diagram shows the full sequence of interactions between the classes involved in the realization of this user story.

### Alternative 2 - Split Diagram

This diagram shows the same sequence of interactions between the classes involved in the realization of this user story, but it is split in partial diagrams to better illustrate the interactions between the classes.

It uses interaction ocurrence.
