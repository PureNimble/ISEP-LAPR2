# US 019 - As a network manager, I want to divide the set of all stores into two subsets, so that the total number of properties of the stores between the two subsets is the closest possible.

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a network manager, I want to divide the set of all stores into two subsets, so that the total number of properties of the stores between the two subsets is the closest possible.



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Each store in the network has a store manager and the set of stores is managed by a store network manager.

>	The manager of the network intends to analyse the performance of each of the branches and the global behaviour of the network on a daily basis.



**From the client clarifications:**

> **30 de May de 2023**
> 
> US 19 says that we must divide the stores into 2 groups with the smallest different of properties managed on each group possible.
>> **Question:** Does it include only properties that are announced or does it also include properties that are pending agent approval for announcement.
>>
>> **Answer:**  Please consider properties whose the purschase order was accepted. In other words, deals that were done/made.
> 
> > **Question:** What should we do with the list? Is it only for display or are we supposed to save it?
> >
> > **Answer:** The system should display the lists to the network manager.

> **2 de June de 2023**
> 
> >**Question:** In US019, our team had some doubts regarding the information that is going to be analyzed. According to many MDISC teachers, we are only supposed to process the information within a CSV file chosen by the network manager. However, in the US description and acceptance criteria there isn't any mention of this, implying that we need to use all the information that's registered in our system. This situation also applies to MATCP, seeing the regression models, according to subject teachers, also should be generated using the CSV file information.
> >
> > **Answer:** In USs 17, 18 and 19, the network manager and the store manager should be able to explore/analyze ALL deals that are registered in the system. To develop the work required by MATCP and MDISC courses, you should have a clean/empty system and you should load the CSV file that is already available in moodle (please the link "CSV file generated by the legacy system to be explored in US17, US18 and US19" available in moodle).
>
> > **Question:** Should the CSV legacy file be used as a file that has the purchase orders that were accepted and therefore be used in the US019 or does the CSV file not contain the type of deals we are looking for?

> >**Question:**  In US19 on AC3, when generating the lists for the runtime tests, do we have to include the full format provided in the csv given to us, or just the relevant parameters for this specific us?
> >
> > **Answer:** I think I do not understand your question. Even so, in a previous answer I said: "In USs 17, 18 and 19, the network manager and the store manager should be able to explore/analyze ALL deals that are registered in the system. To develop the work required by MATCP and MDISC courses, you should have a clean/empty system and you should load the CSV file that is already available in moodle (please check the link "CSV file generated by the legacy system to be explored in US17, US18 and US19" available in moodle)." Moreover, if you read carefully the AC2 and AC3 of US19 you will figure easily what is the input and output that I want you to consider. Important: CSV files are loaded in US12!


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The application should implement a brute-force algorithm, an algorithm  which consists of calculating all the partitions of cardinal 2 and finding out which one is the minimum for the difference of the sum of the elements of each sublist.
* **AC2:** The algorithm should return the sublists of the partition (each sublist should contain a set of tuples with two elements each, the storeID and the number of properties manage by the store) that satisfies the stated condition and also the difference between the sums of the elements of the sublists. In the user manual, this algorithm must be written in pseudocode.
* **AC3:** Runtime tests for variable length n input lists, with com n = 3, 6, 9, â€¦, 30 (asymptotic behavior) should be performed. In each run the number of stores should be chosen sequentially. In the user manual, the results of measuring the time of each algorithm for one/several inputs of the same size, as also the graphic of the asymptotic behavior of the execution time should be presented (use a unit of time that allows you to distinguish the running times of all tested examples). Also, it should be presented the input list, the two sublists that make up the partition and difference of sums, for at least one example of each input size.
* **AC4:** Worst-case time complexity of the algorithm should be documented in the application user manual (in the annexes, where algorithms should be written in pseudocode) that must be delivered with the application.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US5: As a system administrator, I want to register a store.", because the for this US we have to have registered stores.
* There is a dependency to "US2: As an agent, I can publish any sale announcement on the system, for example received through a phone call." and "US8: As an agent, I intend to see the list of property announcement requests made to myself, so that I can post the announcement.", because for the stores to have associated properties, there must be advertisements published, as these are the ones that will contain the properties.
* There is a dependebcy to "US10: As a client, I place an order to purchase the property, submitting the order amount." and "US11: As an agent, I want to list real estate purchase orders to accept or decline a purchase order for a property. After accepting or declining, an email notification should be sent to the customer.", because to list, we have to base ourselves on the amount of offers that each store has.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Output Data:**

* List of the two subsets and the minimum sum difference
