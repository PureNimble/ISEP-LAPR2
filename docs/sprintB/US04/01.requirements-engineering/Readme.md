>
> **Asked at:** 11:27
>
> **Question:**  In one of the previous questions you have stated that for now the only way that an agent can receive the sale announcement request is through a phone call. However, US004 states that "As an owner, I intend to submit a request for listing a property sale or rent, choosing the responsible agent". Isn't submitting a request for listing a property the same as a sale announcement request? If not, can you clarify?
>
> **Answer:**  In my previous answer, when I said "...the only way that an agent can receive the sale announcement..." I was talking about the agent as an actor of the system that introduces in the system property data.

> **Date:** Friday, April 14 of 2023

> **Question:**  It was previously stated that an unregistered user could do a property listing request. However, with the introduction of US007, I want to clarify and make sure that now a user needs to be registered in order to buy, sell or rent properties, or if they can still do it unregistered.
>
> **Answer:** In Sprint B we introduce US7 and now, in US4, the owner needs to be registered in the system to submit a request for listing. You should update all artifacts to include this change.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:**  The owner has to provide information about: the type of property; the area in m2; the location; the distance from the city center; the requested price and one or more photographs.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a dependency to US003 "As a system administrator, I want to register a new employee.", since the agents need to be registered in the app so the owner can choose them.
There is a dependency to US005 "As a system administrator, I want to register a store", since the existence of a store is necessary for the presence of an agent.
There is a dependency to US006 "As a system administrator, I want to specify states, districts and cities in the system." since the owner needs to be able to select the location of the property he's trying to sell.
