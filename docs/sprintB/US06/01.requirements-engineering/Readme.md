**From the specifications document:**

>	N/A.


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Note:** The addresses/locations that will be registered in our system do not include municipalities and parishes. Therefore, we rewrote US6. Please check the pdf file, available in moodle, that introduces the requirements for sprints A and B. Municipalities and parishes could be replaced by states and cities. **Thursday, March 30 of 2023 at 16:16**

> **Question:** In user story 006, it says "As a system administrator, I want to specify districts, municipalities, and parishes in the system." What is the purpose of this function, how does the system administrator intend to use the ability to specify different locations?
>  
> **Answer:** The goal is to specify in the system information that can be used/selected to fill the location of the property. An example of the store location is: 71 ST. NICHOLAS DRIVE, NORTH POLE, FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR, AK, 99705. For instance, if the information about the existing US states is specified in the system, then the user only selects AK and does not need to write this information.
