# US 001 - Display listed properties


## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As an unregistered user, I want to display listed properties.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


**From the specifications document:**

>	All registered information, except the agency comission, can be acessed by the client who intends to buy or rent the property.

>	The client is responsible for being able to consult the properties by type, number of rooms, and sort by criteria such as price or the parish where the property is located.


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** When a unregistered user wants to list properties, the list given by the program is sorted by default with which criteria? For example the list is shown with the properties sorted by most recently added?
>
> **Answer:** Thank you for your suggestion. By default, the list should be shown with the properties sorted by most recently added.


> **Question:** Can an user filter the properties list for example by a type but choosing multiple values? For example the users wants to see only properties with 3 or 4 rooms. If this is possible, after filtering the list to show only the values chosen, he can sort by ascending/descending?
>
> **Answer:** The user should select only one value for each feature of the property. By default, the list should be shown with the properties sorted by most recently added.


> **Question:** An unregistered user can olny see sale announcements or he is able to contact the agency agents to make a purchase request?
>
> **Answer:** From the project description: "As an unregistered user, I want to display listed properties". For now this is the only functionality of the system that the non-registered user can use.


> **Question:** In the project description it is stated that "the client is, then, responsible for being able to consult the properties by type, number of rooms, and sort by criteria such as price or the parish where the property is located.". Is the client able to sort properties by only these 4 criteria or is he able to sort properties by any of the properties' characteristics?
>
> **Answer:** The client should be able to select the type of business (renting or buying), the type of property and the number of rooms. Then, the client should be able to sort properties by price or by parish where the property is located.
If the client does not select the type of business, the type of property and the number of rooms, the application should allow the client to sort all properties that are on sale or on renting.


> **Question:** When an unregistered user opens the application, are there already properties being listed? If the answer is "YES": then by default, by which criteria are the properties listed? If the answer is "NO": is it mandatory for the user to choose an option (type, number of rooms) or can he/her simply request to view a list of properties that will be automatically ordered, for example, by "most recent"?
>
> **Answer:** I already clarified what the unregistered user will see and what he can do within the application. If the system does not contain any properties, the system should show an empty list of properties.


> **Question:** In the project's documentation it's mentioned that "All those who wish to use the application must be authenticated", but in the US1 it's said that an unregistered user can see a list of properties. Can users who aren't authenticated do this?
>
> **Answer:** Non-authenticated users can only list properties.


> **Question:** The one of the search criteria is "number of rooms". Is "Number of Bedrooms" or "Number of Bathrooms" or both?
> 
> **Answer:** Number of Bedrooms.
